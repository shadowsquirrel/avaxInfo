                <p></p>
                <p>Thank you for accepting the experiment invitation. </p>
                <p>You will be paid in USDC. USDC is a crypto currency and a stable coin pledged to the US Dollar. <a href="https://coinmarketcap.com/de/currencies/usd-coin/ " target="_blank">https://coinmarketcap.com/de/currencies/usd-coin/</a></p>
                <p>The payment will be transferred to your wallet on the Avalanche blockchain.
                    The Avalanche Blockchain is a new and ambitious blockchain which like Ethereum uses smart contracts to support a variety of blockchain projects.
                    The Avalanche Protocol uses the Proof of Stake mechanism with a high scalability, resulting in low transaction fees and faster transactions.
                    Furthermore, the security of the consensus mechanism for transactions is enhanced by using a unique method that requires many small, random subsets of network participants to confirm transactions before the transactions are finished.
                    More information about the growing network of the Avalanche blockchain can be found on the Avalanche Twitter page: <a href="https://twitter.com/avalancheavax/status/1501217040752910336?cxt=HHwWgIC5zbu8stUpAAAA" target="_blank">https://twitter.com/avalancheavax/status/1501217040752910336?cxt=HHwWgIC5zbu8stUpAAAA</a>.</p>
                    <p>In order to participate and to receive the payment, you need an Ethereum compatible wallet, which can interact with WalletConnect. I would recommend using the MetaMask App for Android or iOS (<a href="https://metamask.app.link" target="_blank">https://metamask.app.link</a>).
                        If you are new to blockchain and cryptocurrencies, you can download the app and follow the steps to create a new wallet:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Open the App and go to new wallet. Enter a strong password and confirm it. MetaMask cannot recover this password, so you need to remember it.</li>
                            <li>Secure your wallet, by storing a unique seed phrase. A seed phrase is unique to every account and it provides the only way to recover your wallet by importing your account using the seed phrase. Neither loose nor share your seed phrase with anyone.</li>
                            <li>Enter the seed phrase and click the "Complete Backup" button.</li>
                            <li>Your account has been successfully created. The wallet has a public address and a private address. Never share your private address with anyone, otherwise your assets might get stolen. </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>If the Experiment is running on your private PC, you can also use the MetaMask browser extension. In the case of using a Wallet browser extension like MetaMask, make sure NOT to start the experiment in Incognito Modus. </p>
                        <p><strong>Caution: </strong>The Coinbase mobile Wallet is not supported. Please use an alternative!</p>
                        <p>The USDC token  (or USD Coins) will be transferred a few hours after the experiment. To view your experiment payments and your assets on the Avalanche Blockchain, you need to connect to the Avalanche C-Chain.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>ChainID: 43114 </li>
                            <li>RPC URL: https://api.avax.network/ext/bc/C/rpc </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>An explanation on how to do it can be found there: https://support.avax.network/en/articles/4626956-how-do-i-set-up-metamask-on-avalanche</p>
                        <p>
                            If you like to see the USDC token balance on your wallet you have to add them first to your wallet:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Open MetaMask</li>
                            <li>Click on "Token importieren"</li>
                            <li>insert the Token Address: 0xB97EF9Ef8734C71904D8002F8b6Bc66Dd9c48a6E and the Token Symbol: USDC</li>
                            <li>click importieren</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>The Token should be visible in your wallet. Technical information about the Token can be found here: <a href="https://snowtrace.io/token/0xB97EF9Ef8734C71904D8002F8b6Bc66Dd9c48a6E" target="_blank">https://snowtrace.io/token/0xB97EF9Ef8734C71904D8002F8b6Bc66Dd9c48a6E</a></p>
                        <p>After the transfer is accomplished, you can store the COINS, or change it into real World money, or exchange them into other assets like tokens (<a href="https://traderjoexyz.com/trade" target="_blank">https://traderjoexyz.com/trade</a>), or transfer them across blockchains through bridges.</p>
