                            Cryptocurrencies are digital assets living on a blockchain that can be exchanged for other
                            digital assets or for fiat money, such as the euro or the US dollar.

                        <strong>What is a blockchain?</strong><br>

                        <span>
                            Blockchain is a technology based on the science of cryptography allowing secure recording of
                            digital transactions and the creation of unique digital rights.

                        <strong>What is USDC?</strong><br>

                        <span>
                            USDC is a "stablecoin," a cryptocurrency <em>with a value always equal to 1 US Dollar
                                (USD)</em>.
                        </span>

                        <strong>How does USDC maintain its value (peg) of 1 USD?</strong><br>

                        USDC is a fully colletaralized fiat backed stablecoin. That is,
                        for every USDC, there is a US Dollar stored in a bank. In addition, market incentives are in
                        place to ensure the stability of its peg.

                    <p>
                        <strong>What do I need to receive USDC?</strong><br>
                        To receive the payment in USDC you need a cryptocurrency wallet for the Avalanche blockchain. If
                        you don't have one right now, you can create it after the experiment.

                        <strong>Avalanche Blockchain</strong><br>

                        The Avalanche Blockchain is a new and ambitious blockchain that supports smart
                        contracts and is Ethereum compatible. Avalanche uses a novel Proof of Stake mechanism with high
                        scalability, resulting in
                        low transaction fees and faster transactions.
                        <!-- <br><br>
                Furthermore, the security of the consensus mechanism for transactions is enhanced by using a
                unique method that requires many small, random subsets of network participants to confirm
                transactions before the transactions are finished. -->
