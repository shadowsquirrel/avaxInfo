    <p>The USDC we sent you is stored on the C-Chain of Avalanche.
    When moving your assets out of your MetaMask Wallet, make sure your
    destination wallet is compatible. You can move your USDC using the
    cross-chain function, e.g. to a binance wallet.
    You need to set up an account on binance here.
    As an alternative to binance, you can also use Coinbase,
    FTX, Crypto.com and others but we go through how it’s done on binance (desktop):
    </p>
    <p>
    When you are logged in on binance, on the top go to wallet
    -> overview and select deposit -> crypto deposit.
    Click select coin and search for USDC.
    Next, select the AVAX C-Chain Network.
    Binance now shows you your public address to which you need to send your
    USDC token from MetaMask. Copy this address and make sure you don't forget
    any digit, otherwise your money will be lost when sending it.
    </p>

    <p>
    Also, double check when sending your assets:
    The C-Chain addresses start with a “0” similar to Ethereum or
    Binance Smart Chain (BSC) addresses.
    </p>
    <p>
    Go to MetaMask, make sure you are using the Avalanche Network
    (should be displayed on the top) and your USDC is shown.
    Click send and paste the address you copied from binance to
    transfer your USDC to your binance account. On the Avalanche Blockchain, such transactions should cost the equivalent of less than one euro
    </p>

    <p>
    In the next step you need to change your USDC to EUR on binance.
    For this, go to trade -> binance convert.
    Select USDC and EUR and the amount you want to convert and confirm.
    Binance does not take any fees for this conversion but there is a small spread.
    </p>

    <p>
    You should at some point see the corresponding EUR amount in your wallet -> overview.
    </p>
    <p>
    To transfer your fiat currency to your bank account,
    go to wallet -> overview select withdraw and follow the
    steps for a SEPA money transfer (fee: 1€).
